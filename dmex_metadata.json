Once it is provided, click on Search to generate report Clear Functionality:Selecting Clear will reset all the applied filters to their default values, ensuring a clean slate for a new search. The system will fetch and display all reports within the selected date range for the Tool product type. These results are based on updates made in Purchase Inward STEP 4: UNDERSTANDING SEARCH RESULTS TABLE: The Tool Report Search Results Table displays detailed records. Below is an explanation of each column and its flow: SLNO (Serial Number):Specifies a unique identifier for each row in the table. Product Number:Specifies a unique code or identifier assigned to each product. Product Name:Specifies the full description or name of the product. Before purchasing a tool, a supplier purchase order (PO) is created. Once the tool is inwarded, it gets added to the Opening Balance field. Opening Balance:The maximum available quantity at the start of the day for the tool part. Opening Balance Value:Specifies the total value of the opening balance. Inward Quantity:The total quantity inwarded for that particular tool part. Inward Quantity Value:Specifies the total value of the inward quantity. Outward Quantity:The number of parts consumed from the opening balance during that particular day. Outward Quantity Value:Specifies the total value of the outward quantity. Closing Balance:The remaining quantity after subtracting the outward quantity from the opening balance. Closing Balance Value:Specifies the total value of the closing balance. For example:\n\nIf you inward 100 items for a specific tool part via the purchase inward screen, it will reflect in the Inward Quantity field as 100, along with its price in the Inward Quantity Value field.\nIf 50 parts are consumed through the consumption screen, this will appear in the Outward Quantity field as 50, with its price in the Outward Quantity Value field.\nThe remaining 50 parts will be shown in the Closing Balance field, with their price in the Closing Balance Value field.\nThe Closing Balance of today becomes the Opening Balance for the next day. If no additional consumption occurs, the closing balance remains unchanged and equal to the inward quantity. However, if more quantities are consumed, the closing balance will reduce accordingly. This flow ensures accurate tracking of quantities and values throughout the period. These fields are typically used for tracking stock movements, including the quantity and value of products at different stages of their lifecycle within a given time period. \n       The Grand Total provides a summary of the cumulative values across all rows, giving an overall view of the data in the table. Step 5: ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF THE TABLE: Sorting:Each column header allows sorting in both ascending and descending order, making it easier to organize and analyze data Pagination:The table displays the total number of records along with navigation options such as \"Previous,\" \"Next,\" and specific page numbers. Entries Per Page:A dropdown at the bottom of the table allows users to select the number of entries to display per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50, 100). Excel Export:Allows users to export the current data into an Excel file. This feature enables users to further analyze or share the report outside of the application. Print:Enables users to print the displayed data directly from the table. It generates the report, ensuring that users can have hard copies for other purposes. By providing these structured results with flexible navigation and additional features, the table enhances user compatibility and ensures efficient analysis.
